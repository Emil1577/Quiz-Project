## Decription

This JavaScript Code Quiz Project.  It has 5 questions total and theyâ€™re all multiple choice. Upon completion, it will show your score and will ask you to enter your name.  Your name will be then added to the High Score list if you make it to top 5. High Scores list will then be shown right after you enter your name.  Good luck and have fun!
